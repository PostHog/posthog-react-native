# PostHog React Native

> **PLEASE NOTE** From version 2.0.0 onwards, `posthog-react-native` is now based on our [TypeScript Core](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-lite/tree/master/posthog-react-native) which supports **React Native** standalone projects as well as **Managed Expo** projects as it no longer depends on any custom native modules. For development or issues please [go to the new project](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-lite/tree/master/posthog-react-native)

> For version 1.x.x users you can check out the branch `v1` of this repository


Please see the main [PostHog docs](https://www.posthog.com/docs).

Specifically, the [React Native integration](https://www.posthog.com/docs/integrations/react-native-integration) details.
